#' Expectations: is the output or the value equal to a known good value?
#'
#' For complex printed output and objects, it is often challenging to describe
#' exactly what you expect to see. `expect_known_value()` and
#' `expect_known_output()` provide a slightly weaker guarantee, simply
#' asserting that the values have not changed since the last time that you ran
#' them.
#'
#' These expectations should be used in conjunction with git, as otherwise
#' there is no way to revert to previous values. Git is particularly useful
#' in conjunction with `expect_known_output()` as the diffs will show you
#' exactly what has changed.
#'
#' Note that known values updates will only be updated when running tests
#' interactively. `R CMD check` clones the package source so any changes to
#' the reference files will occur in a temporary directory, and will not be
#' synchronised back to the source package.
#'
#' @section 3rd edition:
#' `r lifecycle::badge("deprecated")`
#'
#' `expect_known_output()` and friends are deprecated in the 3rd edition;
#' please use [expect_snapshot_output()] and friends instead.
#'
#' @export
#' @param file File path where known value/output will be stored.
#' @param update Should the file be updated? Defaults to `TRUE`, with
#'   the expectation that you'll notice changes because of the first failure,
#'   and then see the modified files in git.
#' @param version The serialization format version to use. The default, 2, was
#'   the default format from R 1.4.0 to 3.5.3. Version 3 became the default from
#'   R 3.6.0 and can only be read by R versions 3.5.0 and higher.
#' @param ... Passed on to [waldo::compare()].
