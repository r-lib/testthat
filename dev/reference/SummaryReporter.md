# Report a summary of failures

This is designed for interactive usage: it lets you know which tests
have run successfully and as well as fully reporting information about
failures and errors.

You can use the `max_reports` field to control the maximum number of
detailed reports produced by this reporter.

As an additional benefit, this reporter will praise you from
time-to-time if all your tests pass.
