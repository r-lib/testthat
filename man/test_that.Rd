\title{Create a test.}
\usage{
test_that(desc, code)
}
\arguments{
\item{desc}{test name.  Names should be kept as brief as possible, as they
are often used as line prefixes.}

\item{code}{test code containing expectations}
}
\description{
A test encapsulates a series of expectations about small, self-contained
set of functionality.  Each test is contained in a \link{context} and
contains multiple expectation generated by \code{\link{equivalence}}.
}
\details{
Tests are evaluated in their own environments, and should not affect
global state.

When run from the command line, tests return \code{NULL} if all
expectations are met, otherwise it raises an error.
